        "A [Bayesian network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) (also known as a Bayes network, Bayes net, belief network, or decision network) is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). \n",
        "\n",
        "* Bayesian networks are ideal for taking an event that occurred and predicting the likelihood that any one of several possible known causes was the contributing factor. \n",
        "* For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. \n",
        "* Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases."
