There, French doors open from the family room and sun room to a stepped patio area finished in stone. 

The enviable size of the rear garden places neighbouring houses a considerable distance away.

Here, a large central island topped with solid Iroko wood is surrounded by a bespoke suite of floor and wall units enclosing a large range-style cooker. Double doors lead in turn to a sun room/casual dining room with French doors opening to the garden. Adjoining the kitchen is a large downstairs shower room and a garage with tiled floor and fitted storage cupboards. 

Upstairs on the first floor return, the main bedroom suite features a vaulted ceiling with timber beams and an arched window overlooking the rear garden. There is a range of wardrobes and fitted storage and an ensuite shower room.

1693,12169174,Howth,4,5,C3,"""Somali""is a rare home with a rich history surrounded by extraordinary natural beauty. 

It has evolved to become an architectural triumph with origins from 1912 and aptly derives its name from the great Herbert Park exhibition of 1907. The exhibition led this particular part of Howth to become known locally as Somali Village, a term used daily among residents.

Briefly renamed Drumnigh, it was re-designed by one of Irelands most celebrated architects Michael Scott in or around the 1950's.

The house had languished vacant for many years until Crean Salley Architects were commissioned in c2001 by its current owners. The result is a remarkable achievement,  a sensitive enhancement of a genuine deco style taking every advantage of its hypnotic elevated location. 

On completion, the owners returned to the original name Somali, as this was the expressed wish of the first owners descendants, a fitting end to the story so far. 

On arrival, the long winding driveway glides and winds upwards several stories to the parking bays. At this level the breath-taking views are revealed as is the monumental scale of this fascinating home.

The reception hall is wide and bathed in perfect southerly light.

To the west off this hall is the architects cantilevered extended drawing room set the at a lower level to the original room, creating a split level with increased ceiling height. This generously proportioned space is ideal for entertaining as expansive sliding glazed panels open onto the terrace where views are captivating by day and spellbinding by night. Scotts' original fireplace remains, linking past with present in stylish fashion.

A few short steps from here lead to the added family room adjoining the drawing room and connected directly to an open plan contemporary kitchen. These spaces link seamlessly for easy family living and open to the terraces from which the comings and goings of Dublin bay below can be enjoyed.

Outside the kitchen along the rear, a large glazed screen opens onto views of the hill behind and lights a double height space providing access to the master bedroom suite, a private roof terrace and a family library and study. Roomy enough to hide here for hours on top of the world !

Beyond the staircase returns to the hall where a neat cinema room is ideally located. The main hall leads into a long glazed inner hallway beyond and to the rear revealing a stone courtyard and water feature. Here, three additional bedrooms are side by side, each with smart en-suite shower rooms and special bay views. 

At the end of the hall is the entrance to a spectacular home spa featuring a pool and a large gym and recreation space. Basic entertaining services are available here while a frameless glazed wall reveals Dublin bay views and easy access to a private terrace, inviting to outside and facing south. 

A bespoke staircase leads down to the lower ground floor with more recreational space and a games room, steam room and laconium room. Access is available from here to a fully equipped self-contained one bedroom apartment, with separate access at the front and its own paved courtyard.

Somali has aged admirably over a century of time, while architecturally it's as relevant today as when it was first created.

The elevated site stretches across the southern slopes of the Howth peninsula where a perfect southerly aspect bathes private grounds covering c1.5 acres. Those acres have had the benefit of time to grow a blanket of privacy and seclusion on all sides. 

The spellbinding vista offers a uniquely special view spanning the entirety of Dublin bay to the east right into the city scape to the west. At almost 7,790 sq ft (724m2),  the interior is equally impressive while remaining nothing more than a home, albeit a very special one.

ABOUT FOXROCK

The origin of Foxrock dates back to 1859 when builders leased the land and developed the locale in the hopes of it becoming an affluent garden suburb. By creating sweeping houses on large plots, they sought to create a unique setting for those who wanted luxury and space. Alongside this plan, the Leopardstown racecourse was developed in 1888 and the golf club opened in 1898. The racecourse is the only remaining horse-track in the greater metropolitan area. (Source: Foxrock Village history website).

The village is simple in design but has worked well for a number of years as it creates a sense of community. The Gables run by the McCabe family has been a stalwart in the locale for a number of years. They know their wines so anyone who needs advice need look no further. There is also Bistro One for special occasions. For those trendy foodies who want something a bit more relaxed head for Kerb. It has a great menu and welcoming atmosphere. Have you ever wished there was a shop that nearly has everything? Look no further than Thomas€TM of Foxrock. Food, fruit, pastry, you name it he has it and he has a big following in the area!

1877,12091912,Malahide,9,8,,"Seafield House on some 32 hectares (80 acres) is a magnificent and romantic Palladian mansion. Built in the 1730 s it has a rich history and a stunning location. Close to Dublin city centre and Dublin international airport, the house and grounds are totally private and have been refurbished and maintained to the highest standards.

Set out over some 32 hectares (80 acres) of gardens, walled garden, yew tree walk, arable land, forestry and lake. Mansion approx. 895 sq m / 9,634 sq ft (approx.), Coach and stable yard with staff flat and gate lodge.

Ireland has a rich history of magnificent country houses, yet few are located as conveniently as Seafield House. Just 15km from Dublin s city centre, and 8km to Dublin international airport, you ll find yourself in a peaceful world, surrounded by forestry, parklands, and with a view across the estuary to Malahide and the mountains beyond. The Grade 1 listed house itself is a strikingly elegant and romantic five bay three storey over garden level villa. 

Seafield House is thought to have been built by leading Classical architect Sir Edward Lovett Pearce, the leading exponent of Palladianism in Ireland and architect of Castletown House. Pearce died in 1733, and was also the designer of the Irish Houses of Parliament (now the Bank of Ireland building at College Green). Whether directly involved or not, Seafield is clearly in debt to Pearce s elegance and style. The original house was built in approximately 1730, the year Pearce became Surveyor General of Ireland. Just over one hundred years later, in 1857, a west wing was added, along with a striking Italianate tower, adding both balance and intrigue to the elevation. A coach and stable yard, complete with clock tower was also incorporated at this point.

In this way, Seafield House combines the best of two worlds: the sophisticated grace and symmetricality of the Georgian period, for which Dublin s historic core is righty famed; and the warmth and wit of the Victorians. Add to that a fully contemporary overhaul by the present owners, and you have a timeless home to last a lifetime. 

Inside, and setting the scene, a key feature is the extraordinary entrance hall, which runs the full width of the building, linking the building to the gorgeous countryside and creating a magical space of light, and drama. Including a galleried walkway at first floor level and incorporating the original panelling, with wall paintings of figures from Classical mythology, this is a space to conjure with. 

Seafield House was originally built for Benedict Arthur, sometimes spelled Arthure, who had been High Sheriff of Dublin. From him, it passed into the ownership of the Hely-Hutchinson family, who attained great significance in Irish political history. The house was then sold to Sir Robert and Lady Goff, and thence to the present owners. It is now awaiting the next chapter in its illustrious story. 

A House Rich With History

The full extent of the Hely-Hutchinson family fortunes date from the a series of marriages, most notably with the Hatch family, for whom Hatch Street in Dublin is named. In 1834, Sophia Synge Hutchinson married her cousin, a naval captain, the Hon Coote Hely-Hutchinson, bringing the estates of Seafield and nearby Lissen Hall in Swords into the same family ownership, and including some 700 acres. 

A donation by the descendants of the family of some 110 boxes of letters, legal papers, photographs and family memorabilia to the archives of Fingal County Council, give a fascinating insight in to their lives, and also the life of Seafield House. The letters tell of how, during the first World War, two Hely-Hutchinson brothers, Coote and Dick, went off to war, while their father John fought to preserve the family s wealth. They also paint a vivid picture of the decline of the Anglo Irish landed gentry, and point to a possible fate for Seafield, and yet the house survived, magnificently. 

This was thanks to Coote Hely-Hutchinson, who diligently farmed the land, and gained in standing and public opinion in post-Independence Ireland. He worked as a councillor and also served on the board of the Royal Dublin Society, and contributed to philanthropic and social activities. When Coote died in 1930, W.T. Cosgrave, the first elected head of the Irish Free State, wrote to his widow, Julia, saying his country will miss the splendid public services and activities which he contributed to her welfare for so many years. 

Julia moved to nearby Newport House and Seafield then came into the ownership of Sir Robert and Lady Goff. The current owners purchased Seafield in 1996, and have since lavished care and attention on the property, retaining original features, while completely rewiring, replumbing, reroofing, updating the windows and bathrooms and restoring the fa ade. A new flight of granite steps sweeps up to the front door, taking you into the timeless world of Seafield.

Inside Seafield House

Fully refurbished, and sensitively restored and maintained by a team of passionately committed artisans, who have come to know and love Seafield House as much as the owners, the interiors are a triumph of restoration and upgrading. The hall paintings, from the school of William van der Hagen, are some of the earliest of their kind in Ireland. Meanwhile, the Adam fireplace takes pride of place in the dining room, while a magnificent fireplace rescued from a castle at Lough Lomond makes an impressive focal point in the drawing room. When the current owners have parties, this beautiful room makes a perfect spot for the bar.

Tall windows, deeply recessed, look out over the woodlands, parklands and across the estuary. Wood panelling and delicately picked out plasterwork predominate in the Georgian core of the house, and continues upstairs in the master suites. There are eight bedrooms in all, including a rambling set of suites on the very top floor, which generations of children have enjoyed making their own. 

One of the delights of the house is to be found in its different moods, which nonetheless blend to a seamless whole. There is the elegant, yet comfortable formality of the principal rooms in the Georgian core. This extends through the magnificent hallway, two principal reception rooms and dining room. Here, the paintwork sensitively picks out the original panelling and plasterwork, to museum standards, even though such is the warm and welcoming atmosphere, one feels immediately at home. 

Then, a bright kitchen provides the heart of the Victorian wing, and this part of the house also hosts a peaceful study, where you can deal with the world, while feeling quite at peace from it. Off the kitchen is a scullery, and an intriguing flight of stairs. This takes you up into the tower, where you can revel in commanding views of the surrounding countryside. The lower ground floor includes a wine cellar, laundry room, further cellars and a large den that could become a gym, games room or home cinema.

Choose your mood through the bedrooms. The master suite has glorious views, deep set windows, a magnificent fireplace and large dressing room, but you re spoiled for choice with different views, and aspects across all eight bedrooms. These aspects are integral to the charm of Seafield House as from the sweeping driveway to the elegant forecourt, complete with gravel area and feature fountain, this is a house that is truly at home in its peaceful eighty acre setting. 

A Remarkable Setting

Planting six hundred trees, the current owners have taken every care to continue the story of Seafield outside as well as in. There are approximately fifteen acres of woodland, a south facing walled garden, which gives total privacy, and a kitchen garden, with polytunnel, so you can enjoy the fruits of your grounds at dinner each evening. Mature trees surround the property and bound the sweeping avenue. As you round the avenue, the first impression of the house and setting is breath-taking. 

There are layers of history in the landscaping too. A yew walk echoes the famous one at Lismore Castle in Co Waterford, while stone steps give clues to more walks throughout the grounds. Discover statues of eagles on the top of walls, guarding the occupants; and sit, as the owners like to do, on moonlit evenings, gazing at the track of silver on the calm estuary just outside your own front door.

Seafield House also has its own gate lodge, and a very fine coach and stable yard complete with a traditional blue-faced stable clock all in good working order. The coach yard includes a fully fitted apartment, which would make an ideal staff flat. There is also a barn, fine arched storage areas, and a series of stables, loose boxes and outbuildings, giving plenty of food for thought for future owners, whether equestrian lovers or simply considering the possibilities of all this additional space. Whatever its ultimate use, the coach yard provides the perfect balance to the house itself, completely in keeping with its status and history.

To the front of the house, there are formal gardens, with a fountain and splendid views to savour over the estuary. The land to the front is then laid out in grass. To the rear of the house there are further formal gardens. The land to the rear is in tillage, with some 15 acres of forestry, which gives great privacy and seclusion.",,None,53.472197,-6.175996,detached,895

1885,12287431,Shankill,6,6,,"Wilford House is a beautifully imposing Georgian residence built c. 1790. The main house sits within 8 acres of landscaped gardens which have been planned and maintained with great precision.

The house is approached via a long tree lined gravel driveway which leads to an open forecourt at the front of the house. As soon as one reaches the forecourt, the front fa ade of Wilford House is revealed and acts as a wonderful example of Georgian symmetrical architecture, consisting of 3 bays with a protruding entrance porch centred around the front door.

The entrance, leads through the front porch to a fine reception hall, where the feature staircase winds up and down through the centre of the house and elegantly curves along the walls of the oval stairwell. To either side of the reception hall doors lead into the bright and well proportioned drawing room and dining room.

This level is completed with a bedroom, nursery and guest bathroom on a mezzanine level to the rear. The first floor holds four bedrooms, two of which are suites with dressing rooms and en suite bathrooms and there are two further bedrooms and a bathroom on the second floor.

The lower ground level comprises a cinema room, gym, and large kitchen. Within recent years Wilford House has been renovated to a superbly high standard resulting in a classically luxurious home with all modern conveniences which could be offered. The tasteful renovation has retained the stunning original features of this house, such as the ornate ceiling coving, ceiling roses and window shutters.

Wilford House, previously known as Wilfort House, is a late-Georgian house that was remodelled in the mid-1870s to present the character present today. The earliest person associated with Wilford House is a Harley Hodson, whose ancestor is said to be Dr. John Hodson, who assisted Charles I in his escape from Oxford in 1641. In 1812 he sold Wilford House to Charles Toole and Luke Toole, the house staying in the Toole family until the 1870s. Thereafter a Major John Harvey began a succession of army men occupying Wilford House, with, in sequence, William Henry, Captain Arthur Hill, Colonel Rowan-Hamilton up until more recent times when it has been occupied as a well-positioned family home.

The Coach House located to the rear of the main house has been converted into a large garage, study and meeting room on the ground floor
with a 3 bedroom guest apartment on the first floor. This conversion, while adding some useful additional accommodation, did not in any way alter the exterior fa ade of the original coach house, allowing the courtyard retain its quaint charm.

The eight acres of pleasure grounds which surround Wilford House are simply splendid and are quite possibly some of the finest private gardens in county Dublin. They comprise manicured lawns, a sunken garden, a walled orchard, hazel grove, herb and vegetable garden, a barbeque garden, four separate patio areas and a large pond. The grounds are beautifully punctuated with a broad selection of mature specimen trees.

Wilford House is excellently located almost equidistant between Shankill and Bray just minutes drive from Dublin city centre. The M50 Motorway, which links the majority of Ireland s motorway network is accessible within a two minute drive making every city in Ireland easily accessible within, at most, two and a half hours drive and Dublin airport within twenty five minutes. There is a selection of prestigious schools located within close proximity of Wilford House, including Enniskerry and Rathmichael National and St. Gerard s Primary and Secondary with many more options being available within Dublin city. St. Brendan s College is very close to Wilford House and is a secondary school for boys. Wilford House caters wonderfully for the sporting enthusiast. Within the pleasure grounds there is a selection of charming walks leading through the formal gardens and across the lawns. There are a myriad of options for water sports such as sailing, surfing and water-skiing, among many others, in the nearby coastal towns and villages, for instance D n Laoghaire or Dalkey. There is a wide selection of superb golf courses nearby including Woodbrook, Powerscourt and D n Laoghaire.

1890,12341188,Dalkey,6,5,F,"An exceptionally attractive wonderfully appointed detached double fronted two storey over basement level Victorian period residence superbly positioned on Victoria Road oozing charm and character just a short stroll from the seafront, the marine activities on Coliemore Road and the superb amenities and facilities that are in Dalkey Town Centre including the DART.



Albert House is a superb example of a Victorian period residence. It has been wonderfully maintained over the years and retains all the period embellishments of the era including decorative ceiling coving, sliding sash windows and original doors as well as beautiful examples of period marble fireplaces. On entering the property one is immediately struck by the bright and airy generous accommodation that extends to approximately 409sq.m (4,400sq.ft) over the three levels. Being double fronted, the two principle reception rooms either side of the hall are beautifully proportioned and run front to back of the property one of which opens through to a dining room. The kitchen/breakfast room adds an extra dimension to the rear of the property and overlooks and opens into the sunny south facing private rear garden.


Upstairs on the first floor there are three excellent double bedrooms, two of which are dual aspect and enjoy stunning sea views of the Muglins and Dalkey Island. The master bedroom benefits from a walk-in wardrobe and a large en suite bathroom. A family bathroom with unparalleled views concludes the accommodation at this level.


The spacious basement with higher than expected ceilings provides a sitting room, two en suite bedrooms and a utility/boiler room. It has the added advantage of its own separate access making it very versatile as self-contained accommodation for a relative or a wonderful environment for kids to mature into teenagers with their friends.


The gardens of Albert House extend to approximately 0.12Ha (0.3 acre). Electric gates open into the front providing secure off street parking for a number of cars and there is a double garage which always comes in handy. The remainder is set out in lawn and is bordered by high trees giving immense privacy and seclusion although some clever thinning out or topping would ensure highly sought after sea views from the principle reception rooms at the hall level. The cobble locked and gravelled rear garden is very private and has a sought after sunny south facing orientation that is ideal for al fresco dining.


Victoria Road connects Sorrento Road with Coliemore Road and is positioned right in the heart of the Heritage Town of Dalkey. Dalkey is one of the most appealing sought after locations in South County Dublin to live in, as it is surrounded by a wide selection of primary and secondary schools including Loreto Abbey Dalkey, Castle Park and the Harold National School whilst the DART in the town services Blackrock College, St. Andrew's College, St. Michael's College and the city centre. Dalkey provides a plethora of local and specialist shops, cafes, delicatessens, bars and some of the finest restaurants in South County Dublin.


Albert House is a short stroll from Coliemore Harbour and the hugely popular Vico bathing area. It enjoys scenic tranquil walks along the seafront and over Dalkey/Killiney hills. There are excellent sporting and recreation facilities to be enjoyed close by such as Cuala GAA/Dalkey United, tennis, hockey and rugby clubs with a host of fitness clubs and gyms also within close proximity. The four yacht clubs and extensive marina will be of major interest to the marine and sailing enthusiast. Dalkey is also serviced by the 111 bus route and the Aircoach on Hyde Road services the airport hourly.

1925,12072203,Rathmichael,4,4,B2,"Westwicke is a magnificent contemporary detached house built in 2008 standing on c. 1.2 acres of mature private grounds. The house is approached via a smart driveway leading to a parking area and extensive lawns bordered by mature trees and shrubbery. The site is wonderfully secluded and offers stunning panoramic views. The interiors of approximately 496 sq.m. /  5,339 sq.ft. are bright and extensive with impressive reception accommodation, a fabulous open plan kitchen/dining room in addition to four fine bedrooms and four bathrooms. 

Westwicke was built to the very highest standards. Concrete floors and walls ensure an extremely solid building offering peaceful quiet interiors even when fully occupied. Every feature, designed by John Cantrell of Cantrell Crowley Architects, is of the finest quality. The kitchen for example (by Alan Browne), with its superb island unit and fitted appliances in addition to generous dining space, is exceptional. Each bedroom has its own bathroom with bedrooms one and two both benefiting from a private dressing room. These rooms could be converted into bedrooms with minor alterations if required. Other features of note include the high ceilings, high quality paint finishes, beautiful open fireplaces, an elegant staircase in addition to high quality walk in wardrobes and cabinetry throughout. The heating is underfloor throughout fueled by Bulk Gas (storage tank on-site). The windows are high quality Nordan double glazed ensuring the BER reaches the impressive rating of B2. 

Outside the gardens of 1.2 acres are charming offering wonderful seclusion with a sunny southerly orientation to the rear. These gardens and patios, designed by a medal winner at The Bloom Festival, Lurene Fitzpatrick, are smart and well planted and laid out in such a way that those living at Westwicke enjoy the seclusion and sunny aspect the site offers.

The location is second to none. Quarry Road (off Ferndale Road) is a very desirable address and is predominantly characterised by exclusive homes on substantial mature grounds. Westwicke's gardens offer a real sense of country living yet this location offers all the benefits of urban life.  Shankill Village and DART station are close by and the Luas at Cherrywood is just a 5 minute drive away.  There are numerous bus routes servicing the area and the M50 &amp; N11 are close by with Dublin airport just a 25 minute drive away.

1980,11865885,Rathmichael,5,6,G,"Springmount, positioned just seven minutes from all local amenities, the N11 and Dart, is a magnificent residence standing on approximately 9 acres of beautiful grounds enjoying an idyllic setting with formal and informal gardens and views of the sea and surrounding countryside. 

Well set back from the road, with dual access via secure electronically controlled gates which lead to a winding tree lined graveled front avenue past the gate lodge and tennis court to the main residence and cobbled stable yard and coach house.
 Built in the mid to late 1800' s the main house is a collaboration of architectural styles - incorporating generous bedroom accommodation and formal and informal receptions all with direct access to the private grounds. A guest gate lodge was recently refurbished and provides a warm and cozy living space for guests or family needs. There is also a coach house with accommodation on the upper floor off the cobbled stable yard, four stables and a large garage. Throughout the main house, starting with the entrance hall we find beautifully preserved original features and bright rooms with garden views and an abundance of charm and character throughout. The current owners who are only the second ever in Springmount, have managed to create a residence that is a home of distinction, offering any sized family a home with the best of house and garden. They have also succeeded in creating a wonderful blend of exquisite formal accommodation together with comfortable and practical ' everyday' living space. 

In the main house to the right of the entrance hall we have three interconnecting receptions. The smallest of these is used by the current owner to play bridge, the Card room / Library is a wonderful space with an original fireplace and window seat. The main Drawing room is positioned to the rear of the house and provides a beautiful formal room with garden aspect opening out onto the beautiful and grand Garden room with sash windows on all sides and direct access to the garden. These three receptions combined provide a wonderful area for entertaining.

To the right of the hall we have the formal Dining room with bay window and French doors to the gardens. Across the Lobby we have a cozy Family room again with original features and direct access to the garden and the large family sized kitchen with ample dining space, direct access to the garden, large utility and access to the cobbled stable yard.

The bedroom accommodation in Springmount is also impressive. The superb master suite upstairs in the main house provides a private haven incorporating a light and airy bedroom with balcony and views of the acreage and the sea beyond, a dressing room with dual aspect and a sumptuous ensuite bathroom. Also at this level, we have two other large bedrooms with a variety of garden aspects and a recently upgraded Bathroom. We have a superb guest suite at the northern end of the house at ground level and an additional two bedrooms and bathroom upstairs. The main house totals c. 433 sqm.

There is also the added attraction of the two-bedroom gate lodge. A lovely property in its own right which enjoys all of the comforts of modern day convenience, the gate lodge can be accessed via either of the electronically gated driveways and could be separated if desired (subject to P.P.) The bright and spacious accommodation briefly comprises Entrance porch and bay windowed main reception. A working kitchen and two good sized Bedrooms and a modern Shower room. The gate lodge totals an additional 66 sqm. 

 To the side of the main property we find the attractive cobbled stable yard. Here we have the coach house with gym in the ground floor, excellent loft accommodation over and the adjoining two stables. This accommodation measures an additional c.102 sqm.

Also off the cobbled courtyard we have an additional detached double stable block measuring c. 30 sqm. comprising of a further two stables. There is a very large garage with space for several cars with electric secure roller door in the stable yard also. This area is ideal for the motor enthusiast and totals c.70 sqm. The entire courtyard and garage is very secure and private.

The gardens of Springmount provide a tranquil setting with an enjoyable blend of formal and informal grounds. To the right of the main house we have wonderful formal gardens with a cascading water feature and manicured box hedging. Also in this area we find the original orchard with a variety of mature fruit bearing trees. Immediately to the rear of the main house we have more formal grounds bordered by mature hedging and well planted with a colorful array of flowering plants and shrubs. There are sunny sun terraces here too, allowing for a large and beautiful entertaining area encompassing the receptions and the gardens. Beyond these gardens lies the remaining acreage. Mostly laid out in meadow the land is quite level and features plenty of space to keep horses if desired. There is also an all weather arena, hard tennis court and the second graveled drive sweeping across the front of the gate lodge out to what is currently used as the main exit gate. Over all Springmount is a wonderful holding which although in the heart of Rathmichael feels very much removed from it all, in what is a most attractive country setting.

The location is truly ideal. Positioned off the Ferndale road the property is located just a seven minute drive from Shankill Village. With easy access to the N11 and M50 the city center is within a 25 minute drive and the airport is only a 40 minute drive away. Excellent primary and secondary schools are within a short drive.

Inside does not disappoint, the current owners purchased the house in 1959, and have completely transformed the interior creating a real wow factor. On entering the hallway you are greeted with double height ceilings with original architraving. The stairs and have been veneered in solid wood and plush grey carpets, with gold rods frame the stairwell. The decorative banisters are brand new, and have been finished in a beautiful French polish.  Solid oak doors with decorative glass inserts frame each room and hard wooden floors sweep through the property creating a seamless fluidity.

The court yard is a sun-trap and is north west facing giving you sunshine in the afternoon, and has been paved with granite stone slab. The rear garden is a wonderful outdoor space to entertain guests, or to dine al fresco in the summer months.

KELLY BRADSHAW DALTON are excited to announce 44 Shanglas Road, Beaumont, Dublin 9 to the market.
Positioned on this quiet tree lined residential road in Dublin 9, No.44 stands out from the crowd and is sure to cause excitement amongst those looking for a beautiful large three bedroom, two bathroom family home in this mature area of distinction. These well built homes were constructed in 1950 by the renowned builders Griffith &amp; Finn.
With kerb appeal in abundance on arrival to No.44, you are greeted by a beautiful part red brick semi-detached home with bay windows, garage, large drive and enough space to fit up to four cars for off street parking. The driveway is cobble locked, bordered by mature hedging, plants and a picturesque pebbled flower bed.
Presented in superb decorative order throughout, luxury, light, and space set the tone of this wonderful semi-detached property. On entering you get a great sense of home, and are immediately aware of the level of care and attention that has gone into the upgrades and very tasteful decoration throughout. Truly in turn key condition, the only thing you will need to do is sit back and enjoy everything your new home has to offer.
Internally the property is warm and inviting with a wonderful balance of living and sleeping accommodation. Through the solid mahogany front door and into the spacious hallway, one will note and enjoy the great fluidity of the layout. The hall is adorned with semi-solid wood flooring that seamlessly sweeps into the two large reception rooms. Conveniently there is a walk in cloak room and W.C for guests and busy families. Off of the hallway to your right is the formal living room with large bay window, a delightful sumptuous ""grown-up"" space set off by the ambiance created the fireplace with marble surround. A tranquil room where one could get lost in the flicker of the feature gas stove while enjoying a glass of wine and taking in your new surroundings. 
Onto the second family room, again this room is a very impressive space and is drenched in natural light that floods the room through large window, where you can sit and keep an eye on the little ones in the walled rear garden. Painted in clean modern hues and paired with wooden flooring, this is a space where the whole family can sit and enjoy evening activities. The current owners have also done a wonderful job retaining the original panelled doors, architraves and picture rails.
To the rear of the property is the family kitchen cum dining room. Vaulted ceilings set the tone of the room, hand painted solid oak units, tiled splash back and integrated appliances are just some of the treats on offer. Velux windows and spotlights have been fitted above, and with floor to ceiling windows and doors, it is a room where the whole family can cook and dine in comfort. All rooms enjoy above standard ceiling height of 2.6 meters adding to the spacious feel, and was extended in 2005 to allow a large family friendly space. Fitted with hand painted solid oak units, and utility room with access to the garage, there simply is not a thing the current owners have not taken care of. The utility room leads out to the family garage, which is wired for an electric car charger, (7.4W) a wonderful addition to any home.
White double glazed patio doors lead you out to the private mature walled and impeccably manicured rear garden with lawn, cobble-lock and large decking areas.  The garden is a beautiful oasis where you could entertain guests or dine al fresco in the summer months. There is also a timber garden shed for garden tools or sports equipment.
Not to be outdone, upstairs the sleeping accommodation is equally impressive. Feature banisters and carpet flooring lead you to the upper level where there are three large bedrooms, two double and one single. Each bedroom has been fitted quality ivory wardrobes, and high quality curtains and blinds which are generously included in the purchase. 
Also on this level is the family bathroom with built in storage, electric Triton shower, heated towel rail, modern sanity ware with under sink vanity unit and PVC finish ceiling with spotlights. There is also a separate W.C.  ideal for busy families. 
Just when you thought there could be no more to offer, the current owners have also fitted the large attic with double insulation (240 ML) accessed by a pull down ladder for convenience. This is a very warm and inviting home, which has been externally retrofitted with 6 inch rockwool insulation and double glazing, which is entirely maintenance free.
44 Shanglas Road would make the an idyllic family home. A most popular residential neighbourhood, you have every local amenity on your doorstep including shops, primary and secondary schools. Dublin Airport, is a short drive away, Beaumont Hospital is a five-minute drive, Dublin City University is less than a ten-minute drive and the city centre is within a 15-minute commute. The immediate area is also well serviced by numerous bus routes, and excellent transport links to the surrounding country via the nearby M50 and M1 motorways, and easy access to the port tunnel is just a stones' throw away.
Overall this is a wonderful opportunity to purchase a very attractive family home in a well-established neighbourhood and early viewing is strongly advised.",,"Superb Location

The principle bedroom resides on the second floor with an ensuite and a beautiful gable window. A versatile storage space on this floor and a downstairs guest w.c. complete the accommodation inside. The rear garden is laid in Indian sandstone with raised flower beds showcasing an abundance of mature shrubs. Not overlooked, this west facing garden is a great environment to enjoy a relaxing evening of al fresco dining.

Fortfield Square has matured to an incredibly popular residential location for all ages.

The benefits of this location result s in an area where a prospective purchaser can enjoy the best of both worlds, with quiet and peaceful living while also enjoying all that the surrounding area has to offer.

KELLY BRADSHAW DALTON, are delighted to present 14 Iveleary Road, Gaeltacht Park to the market. This beautiful quiet tree lined road is arguably one of the most attractive roads off Collins Avenue and is a highly regarded leafy address, with a brilliant community spirit.  Built in the late 1930's this quiet mature enclave of houses was offered to the Irish speaking community within the Civil Service, who got first priority when launched. The estate, takes a form similar to that of a Celtic cross, with Iveragh Road encircling it. Although the Irish speaking plan never really got off the ground, the community is proud of its origins, and a sign at the entrance declares 'Welcome to Gaeltacht Park'.

No.14 boosts many of its original features, synonymous with homes of this era and is one of most prominent houses on the road with the advantage of the garage to the side. Many of its features are carried through to include imposing feature stained glass bay windows, high ceilings and fireplaces. This partially red brick facade property oozes charm and character and has so much potential for any growing family€TM needs.

As soon as one approaches No.14 you will immediately appreciate the idyllic character this fine residence presents, adorned with beautiful railed garden recessing this charming three bedroom house. It has to be said this is such an impressive faé§ade as soon as you walk into the driveway you are greeted by a beautiful stained glass door. On entering one will be greeted by a great sense of home. There is a bright entrance hall that leads in to two main reception rooms, both are an exceptional size. The reception room to the front of the house captures the beautiful view of the garden and the current owners kept its original stain glass windows that has the same design engraved so the house retains its period charm. The two reception rooms are open plan making entertaining on a grande scale no big deal. The back reception room captures the very private south facing garden to the rear.

To the rear is a fully fitted kitchen that overlooks the magnificent garden space. A very special feature of this fine home is the extension to the side. This sould be a fourth bedroom or a fantastic playroom. There is also the garage to the side excellent for all storage needs or if the new owners desire could be converted STPP.

Upstairs leads up to a light filled landing space with the landing. Off the landing there are two excellent sized double bedrooms both with ample storage space. The third bedroom is a single room but is spacious. A fully tiled bathroom with a separate wc completes the upstairs level.

Another major selling feature is the potential to extend over the garage offering an extra bedroom space.

 There is a large rear south facing garden that offers immense privacy and great potential for anyone looking to extend. There is a paved area that leads out to a magnificent lawn area and mature shrubs and plants make this a real oasis.



The property is superbly located off Collins Avenue, with every possible amenity literally on your doorstep. This north side neighbourhood located about 4km from Dublin city centre, and less than 7km from the airport on the nearby M1 motorway. It would be hard to find an area of north Dublin City with more green space. Ellenfield Park, with its numerous playing fields, is very noticeable from the Swords Road heading towards Dublin Airport, located adjacent to Whitehall Church. Albert College Park is a green lung that feeds into the outdoor grounds of DCU; Courtlands Park serves that 1970s-built housing community and is a lovely, quiet recreational area. There is also a fourth, large, green area to the north of Whitehall, on grounds located within an L-shaped nook of Oak Park Avenue. The twin sporting draws of Whitehall Colmcille GAA and Home Farm FC are also both attractive to buyers, with both sporting organisations well established and with communities developed around them.



This fine residence will make a truly magnificent family home in a nice quiet mature residential location. It's guaranteed to appeal to those looking for a convenient location, a great address and a stylish family home with a private garden in Whitehall, which takes its name from an old period house named 'White Hall', formerly located to the south of the village, on the corner of the Old Swords Road and Griffith Avenue.
