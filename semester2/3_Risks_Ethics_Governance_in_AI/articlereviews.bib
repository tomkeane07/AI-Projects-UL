	abstract = {Identifying indices of effort in post-editing of machine translation can have a number of applications, including estimating machine translation quality and calculating post-editors' pay rates. Both source-text and machine-output features as well as subjects' traits are investigated here in view of their impact on cognitive effort, which is measured with eye tracking and a subjective scale borrowed from the field of Educational Psychology. Data is analysed with mixed-effects models, and results indicate that the semantics-based automatic evaluation metric Meteor is significantly correlated with all measures of cognitive effort considered. Smaller effects are also observed for source-text linguistic features. Further insight is provided into the role of the source text in post-editing, with results suggesting that consulting the source text is only associated with how cognitively demanding the task is perceived in the case of those with a low level of proficiency in the source language. Subjects' working memory capacity was also taken into account and a relationship with post-editing productivity could be noticed. Scaled-up studies into the construct of working memory capacity and the use of eye tracking in models for quality estimation are suggested as future work.},

	abstract = {The review examines ways in which working memory contributes to individual and particularly to developmental differences in writing skill. It begins with a brief definition of working memory and then summarizes current debates regarding working memory and capacity theories in the field of reading. It is argued that a capacity theory of writing can provide a framework within which to consider the development of writing skill, and relevant data are discussed. Effects of capacity limitations are documented in all three component writing processes: planning, translating, and reviewing.},
